## Tensor Shape Registry

The system uses prime factorization to determine optimal tensor shapes for each cognitive kernel:

```scheme
;; Example tensor shape assignment
(define (assign-tensor-shape agentic-function)
  (let* ((semantic-dims (list 'context 'time 'salience))
         (shape (map get-dimension-size semantic-dims)))
    (prime-factorize shape)))
```

## Attention Allocation Mechanism

The ECAN-inspired attention system manages cognitive resources:

```mermaid

    subgraph ECAN
        A1[Kernel Activation Level]
        A2[Usage Frequency]
        A3[Contextual Relevance]

        A1-->|Weighted Sum|A5[Attention Score]
        A2-->|Weighted Sum|A5
        A3-->|Weighted Sum|A5
        A4-->|Weighted Sum|A5
    end
    A5 -->|Directs| B1[Tensor Message Routing]
    A5 -->|Modulates| B2[Cognitive Kernel Prioritization]
```

## Hypergraph Pattern Encoding

Cognitive kernels are represented as hypergraph patterns:

```mermaid
graph LR
    N1((Agentic Kernel))
    N2((Input Percept Node))
    N3((Action Node))
    N4((Attention Membrane))
    N1-->|perceives|N2
    N1-->|acts-on|N3
    N1-->|encapsulated-by|N4
```
